This talk was a lightning talk (and my first talk in front of a lot of
people!). It covered the basics of color theory and why RGB doesn't play well
under addition. From this, I learned that color is important through a
deblurring algorithm (and the results).

Because color is important, colormaps are too. Matplotlib 2.0 is introducing
new defaults and I covered those... and the fact that use of jet can endanger
your health.
